### Installing SpeechUtils

You can install `SpeechUtils library` by downloading the JS Library from the /SRC/ folder and copying the file into your web frontend project.
In this first iteration you can use it by referencing it in the `<head>` section of the HTML file(s). In the near future you'll use it as an `ES6 Module`.

```HTML
<script src="js/class.synthesis-beta.v1.0.0.js"></script>
```

You don't need to use the JS `defer` attribute and you don't need to reference the library at the end of the HTML file. Use the `-min` version with only `2KB` of weight.
