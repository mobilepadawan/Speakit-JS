This library enables you to audibly reproduce any text from a web application in various languages. It utilizes the `SpeechSynthesis` API along with the `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` API to regulate the audio speed, pitch, and voice selection (male or female) across different languages (*) and accents.

Visit our [Official website](https://mobilepadawan.github.io/Speakit-JS/). You'll find a very quick **not-so-technical** guide and a Demo to test the Speakit-JS library functionality.

## Installing Speakit JS

You can install `Speakit JS library` by downloading the JS Library from the `/SRC/` folder of this repository and copying it into your web frontend project. To use it, simply reference the file in the `<head>` section of your HTML file(s).

```HTML
<script src="js/Speakit1.0.1.js"></script>
```

You don't need to use the `defer` attribute for the script tag, and there's no need to reference the library at the bottom of an HTML file. The minified version has a weight of only `2KB` ‚öñÔ∏è, making it lightweight. The unminified version, recommended for testing and improvement purposes, has a weight of only `3KB` üôÇ.

```
üîî In the comming weeks of february 2025 you'll receive an ES6 Module version of this library.
We also will preserve the *CDN* version of this library.
We are finishing then testing process of all its functions.

Stay tuned!
```

## Installing Speakit JS as an NPM package

 As well, any frontend project created by using NodeJS and NPM can let you add this marvelous library, just installing it through NPM command. 

```terminal
   npm install speakit-js
```
Please, visit [NPMJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/speakit-js) to know more.


<br>
<hr>

## How to use it

After referencing the Library into the HTML file of your project, you can configure some properties to a better audio performance.
* **utteranceRate**
* **utterancePitch**
* **getVoices()**

### utteranceRate property

The `utteranceRate` property defines the playback rate of spoken text using the speech synthesizer. This property determines the speed at which the words will be spoken. A value of `1.0` represents **normal speed**, while higher values will increase the speed and lower values will decrease it.

```javascript
  Speakit.utteranceRate = 1.02
```

We recommend using a specific precision, for example, `1.02` or `1.14`. This property is very sensitive, so you should conduct several tests based on the selected language.

Some synthesis languages work well with the value `1.0` while others ones may require a slightly higher value.

```
üîî The default value is set in 1.03. It is not mandatory
to configure a value unless you find the voice speaking
too quickly or sounding distorted.
```

<br>
<hr>

### utterancePitch property

The `utterancePitch` property defines the pitch of the voice used for speech synthesis. This property adjusts the fundamental frequency of the synthesized voice, which can affect the perceived pitch of the voice.

```javascript
  Speakit.utterancePitch = 1.0
```

A value of `1.0` represents normal pitch, while higher or lower values will alter the tone of the voice. Configure this property value with patience, as it is very sensitive.

<br>
<hr>

### getVoices() method

The `getVoices()` method is a static method of the `Speakit` class used to retrieve a list of available voices for speech synthesis in the web browser.

```javascript
  Speakit.getVoices().then(voices => console.table(voices))
```

This method returns an array of SpeechSynthesisVoice objects representing the voices available for use with the speech synthesizer.

```javascript
  voice.lang // property for set the ISO code of a language.
  /*
    'es-MX' Espa√±ol - M√©xico
    'en-AU' English - Australian
    'it-IT' Italian language
  */

  voice.name // represents the name given to the every voice.
  /*
    For example, according to web browser, some voices
    has a name as "Samantha", "Diego", "Karen", etcetera.
  */
```

I recommend testing the code sample below in `DevTools > Console` to view the complete list of voices available in the web browser you are using to code and test your web app. Please note that this list of voices may vary across different web browser engines.

### About the ISO languages

You can use it to populate a list of voices in an HTML `Combo Select` element, an `HTML table` element, or another type of web component, allowing users to choose their preferred voice and tone. Alternatively, for closed applications, you can automatically set a voice based on the locale region configuration declared in the user's web browser.

|ISO Code|Description|
|-|-|
|pt-PT|Portugues - Portugal|
|pt-BR|Portugues - Brasil|
|es-MX|Espa√±ol - Mexico|
|en-US|English - United States|
|en-BR|English - Great Britain|
|en-AU|English - Australia|
|en-HK|English - Hong Kong|

```
üîî Please note that voice availability may vary depending
on the user's web browser and the operating system where
the web app is running.
```
<br>

### Checking your web browser compatibility
If you want to check the web browser compatibility you can execute the `.TTStest()` method. It will **return** if the web browser it is compatible or not with **Speech Synthesis**.

```javascript
  Speakit.TTStest();
```

<hr>

## Some samples

#### How to get the list of available voices

Add a Select HTML element to configure it to display a list of voices:

```html
<select id="language-select">
  <option value="">Pick a language</option>
</select>
```

Next, create a DOM link with the `Select` HTML element.

Then, create a function to retrieve all available voices, iterate through them, and populate the voice list in the Select HTML element with the voice list:

```javascript
const languageSelect = document.getElementById('language-select')

function loadVoicesInSelect(languageSelect) {
  Speakit.getVoices().then((voices)=> {
    if (voices.length > 0) {
      voices.forEach((voice)=> {
        languageSelect.innerHTML += `<option value="${voice.lang}" data-voice="${voice.name}">
                                       (${voice.lang}) - ${voice.name}
                                     </option>`
         })
      }
  })
  .catch((error)=> console.error('Error loading the available voices:', error) )
}
```

The `getVoices()` method is asynchronous and utilizes JS Promises. Ensure effective error handling using the `.then()` and `.catch()` methods.

### Reproducing Audible Text

The `.readText()` method requires the first two parameters. **The first parameter** is the text to be reproduced. It can be a static text as shown in the sample below or, alternatively, text provided by a `textInput`, `textArea`, or another HTML element. Ensure that the text is clean and does not contain HTML tags or similar, as different voices may exhibit unpredictable behavior.

**The second parameter** is the ISO language code for the selected voice: `es-MX`, `en-US`, `it-IT`.

**The third parameter** is optional and represents the voice object corresponding to the selected tone or accent from the available voice list. For example, if you are using `Microsoft Edge` to test your webapp and select `en-HK` as the language to reproduce audible text, you may choose  `Microsoft Sam Online (Natural) - English (Hongkong)`.

You can provide this information as the third parameter, and `Speakit JS` will attempt to retrieve the `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` to audibly reproduce the accent according to your selection. If you do not provide this third parameter, `Speakit JS` will use the default voice language to reproduce the text. 

```javascript
Speakit.readText("This is a text for reproducing it using JS SpeechSynthesis.", 
                 "en-NZ", 
                 voiceName)
.then(()=> console.log('Text successfully readed.') ) //do something
.catch((error)=> console.error('Error reading the text:', error) )
```

The `.readText()` method operates using JavaScript Promises. You can chain a `.then()` method to execute a JavaScript code after the text has been audibly reproduce.

### Pause a speaking action

You can **pause** any current speaking process by using the `.pauseSpeaking` method.

```javascript
Speakit.pauseSpeaking();
```

This action will pause the current speaking process. It is not cancelled but paused waiting for to continue when the `.resumeSpeaking()` will be executed.

### Resume a paused speaking

You can **resume** (continue) reproducing a text in an audible format if you previously paused it by using the `.resumeSpeaking` method.

```javascript
Speakit.resumeSpeaking();
```

This action will continue reproducing the rest of the text since the position where it was paused.

### Stop speaking

If you need to cancel the any speaking process you can stop it by using the `.stopSpeaking` method.

```javascript
Speakit.stopSpeaking();
```

This action will cancel the speaking process and will send a warning to the DevTools JS console by the JS **console** Object. This is not an error or an issue, it is just a warning about the user _(or webapp)_ executed a cancellation action.

## Note about Safari and Firefox browsers

**üîî We detected in Safari and Firefox browsers that the `utteranceRate` and `utterancePitch` properties of the SpeakitJS library must used with a lower value than the default value. Those web browsers play the voice in an accelerated way than the experience got with Chrome and Edge. Please, test it well and make a fine tuning of that properties.**

## Alpha version

(2024-08-02 Updates) üîî

We finally implemented and tested deeply the following new features over Speakit-JS library.

* [x] Specify an ISO Code language to filter the `.getVoices()` method results.
* [x] Adding the filter behavior to the `.getVoices()` method.
* [x] Adding the fallback behavior to the `.getVoices()` method.
* [x] Tested in the main web browser engines.

### Way to use it
`
üîî Consider **avoid to implement the Alpha version in Production environments**. 
`

This version able you to filter a specific type of voice `en`, `es`, `it`, etcetera, by defining the desired ISO language code in the `languageFilter` property.

```javascript
Speakit.languageFilter = "it-IT"
```

After apply this filter, when call the `.getVoices()` method, you will get just the available voices for the selected `ISO Language`.

```javascript
Speakit.getVoices()
.then(()=> console.table(Speakit.totalVoices))
```

Also the `totalAvailableVoices` property will return the proper number of voices, according to the filtered ISO language.

### Another proposal for filtering

Another more flexible way to use the `.languageFilter` property is by tipying the starting part of the ISO language code:

```javascript
Speakit.languageFilter = "es-"
```

This will bring you a list of spanish languages available including all the different accents: `Bolivian`, `Peruvian`, `Argentinian`, `Chilean`, etc. 

You can also filter different languages used in a specific country by tipying the final part of it:

```javascript
Speakit.languageFilter = "-CA"
```

This will bring you the list of all official canadian languages available including of course: `en` and `fr`.

### The .readText() method second parameter behavior

According to the previous way to use this method, we've implemented a default and two fallback behavior for the second parameter.

1. If you send it when you call the .readText() method, Speakit-JS will use it by default. 
2. If you don't send it, Speakit-JS will seek the value defined in the `.languageFilter` property. Please, ensure in this case to define in the mentioned property the complete ISO language code ('it-IT').
3. If you don't send it and don't specify a value in the `.languageFilter` property, Speakit-JS will use 'en-GB' as a language default.

```javascript
// First example
Speakit.readText("This is a text for reproducing it by using JS SpeechSynthesis.", 
                 "en-NZ")
```

```javascript
// Second example
// .languageFilter = 'en-CA'
Speakit.readText("This is a text for reproducing it by using JS SpeechSynthesis.", 
                 "")
```

```javascript
// Third example
// .languageFilter = ''
Speakit.readText("This is a text for reproducing it by using JS SpeechSynthesis.", 
                 "")
```


### About the tests
**All the tests** over the main web browser engines throws good results except with **Apple Safari** desktop version. The Apple's web browser has a very limited support for its internal voices and the filtering method can't get a proper behavior when it is implemented. We need to run more tests to find the best solution and to achive the better experience with the available voices in this  particular web browser.

We still did not tests over **Safari Mobile**. If you can do it, please send us your feedback about the experience on it.
